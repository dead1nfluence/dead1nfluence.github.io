      <span>// In mid-March our research team began looking for a target to assess as part of a long-term project. After some time searching, we set our sights on Furbo. Tomofun, the creators of Furbo, offers two devices which you can set up in your home to monitor your pet's activities throughout the day and, with the higher-end Furbo 360, toss treats their way, send voice messages, and monitor their activities more thoroughly.</span>

      <span>// In the second part of our Hacking Furbo blog series we will focus on the mobile application and P2P communications from it. We will detail our process of identifying the mobile-side of the P2P communications and hooking them with Frida for a deeper understanding of how they work.</span>

      <span>// In this third part of our Hacking Furbo blog series we will focus on the Furbo hardware; specifically our attempts at performing a chip off procedure on the device in order to dump and re-apply our own customized firmware. We will detail how we used the XGecu T48 programmer for the firmware extraction, our struggles to get the correct adapter, and our sad attempt at using a Probe Reader to avoid performing a chip off procedure.</span>

      <span>// In Part 4 of the Hacking Furbo blog series we will detail our dynamic analysis of the Furbo devices. We will show how the device was logging information, how that helped us better understand the binaries and their functions, as well as some developer features that we discovered after reviewing the file system. Using the information collected from our debugging we were able to exploit two more vulnerabilities: a Denial of Service and an Application Logic Bypass which allowed us to have unlimited trial licenses!</span>
